# Hello World Full-Stack Application

A full-stack training project featuring a "Greeting Generator" API built with Node.js and Express, seamlessly integrated with a React frontend powered by Vite. This project demonstrates foundational full-stack development skills, including backend API creation, frontend-backend communication, modern styling with Tailwind CSS, and version control with Git.

## Project Overview

This application consists of two main components:

- **Backend:** A Node.js server using Express to serve a `/greet` endpoint that returns random greetings (e.g., "Hello, [name]!", "Greetings, [name]!") at `http://localhost:5000/greet?name=[name]`.
- **Frontend:** A React application built with Vite, featuring a styled form to fetch and display greetings from the backend at `http://localhost:5173`. The frontend uses Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design, including a gradient background, a centered card, and interactive buttons (e.g., "Get Greeting" and "Clear").

Created as part of a full-stack development training initiative with The AI Union Agency, this project showcases the integration of modern JavaScript technologies.
